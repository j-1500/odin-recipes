    <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>

        <li>  1 pound ground beef </li>
            
        <li>  1 large onion, diced</li>
          
        <li>and more stuff</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add olive oil to a large pot and place over high heat. Add beef; cook and stir, breaking up with a spoon or spatula, about 2 minutes. Add onions and salt, and cook, stirring, until beef is crumbly, and onions turn translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once chili is nearly ready, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in macaroni and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, 1 minute less than specified in package directions, until not quite tender, and still firm to the bite, about 8 to 11 minutes.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes. Let rest 15 minutes before serving, topped with green onions</li>

    </ol>
